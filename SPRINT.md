# Sprint

(Formerly `WORK_QUEUE.md`; renamed to `SPRINT.md` per `AGENTS.md` / the
multi-agent skill.)

Current sprint focus: (1) make Rozum a reliable local meeting room for live agents and a human operator; (2) make Rozum a local LLM provider for Claude Code and Codex via an outward OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible gateway backed by an in-process MLX / GGUF engine on Apple Silicon Metal.

### Top priority (P0): mistralrs Qwen3.6 finish-the-forward — RESOLVED (day 6)

**Root cause found and fixed.** The residual divergence was NOT the
weight-row-ordering hypothesis from days 1-5. It was the **RMSNorm `+1`
convention**: `GemmaRmsNorm::new` bakes `weight = on_disk_weight + 1.0`, but
the sanitized `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` checkpoint uses raw
RMSNorm weights (MLX's `should_shift_norm_weights` is False for sanitized
checkpoints: conv1d `(8192,4,1)`, no MTP). The `+1` over-scaled every norm
(~2.1x) and the silu MoE compounded it to a ~14x experts blow-up + an
over-peaked router. Fix: `GemmaRmsNorm::new_unshifted` for the five norm
sites in `vision_models/qwen3_5_moe/text.rs`.

Full writeup + the one-pass diagnostic methodology that localized it:
`docs/specs/mlx-weight-layout-and-afq.md` section 13. Oracle:
`scripts/mlx_ref.py` (--layers/--attn/--mlp/--router) +
`scripts/mlx_ref.qwen36-hello.txt`. Patch:
`patches/mistralrs-qwen36-afq-wip.patch`.

- [x] qwen36-fullattention-split - VERIFIED ALREADY CORRECT (red herring).
  - `qwen3_5_moe/text.rs` FullAttention already loads separate
    `q_proj/k_proj/v_proj` AFQ layers and its gate-interleave split matches
    `mlx_lm/models/qwen3_next.py::Qwen3NextAttention` exactly. Confirmed
    byte-for-byte: layer-3 (first FullAttention) `||x||` 1.4432 vs Python
    1.4460 once the RMSNorm fix is in. No layout change was needed.

- [x] qwen36-moe-switchmlp-layout - VERIFIED ALREADY CORRECT (red herring).
  - The MLX checkpoint ships experts **pre-fused** as
    `switch_mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj` `(num_experts, out, in)` (no per-expert
    `experts.<i>`). On Metal the `MoEExperts` Fast path -> quant
    `FusedExperts::new` loads them via `AfqLayer::afq_packed_linear_b` and
    the forward applies router weights correctly. The 14x magnitude was the
    RMSNorm bug feeding a 10x input, not a layout/dequant error. Confirmed:
    layer-0 per-expert outputs now match Python's `[0.78,0.25,0.57,...]`.

- [x] qwen36-numerical-parity-gate - PASSED.
  - `"Hello"` (11 tokens) renders identically in both runs; embedding
    byte-for-byte; all 40 layer last-position `||x||` match within bf16
    rounding; top-1 logit `id=8160 'Here' logit=22.0` identical to `mlx_lm`.
    Greedy generation begins identically.
  - Remaining (follow-up, not blocking): thread the fix into the upstream PR
    (`docs/specs/mistralrs-qwen36-pr.md`) and decide whether rozum's
    crates.io `mistralrs` 0.8.1 dep gets a `[patch]` to `.vendor/mistral-rs`
    or waits for an upstream release. NOTE: rozum currently has NO `[patch]`,
    so the fix lives only in `.vendor` + `patches/` until that is wired —
    `rozum`'s own binary still loads unpatched 0.8.1 and Qwen3.6 should keep
    routing through the LM Studio HTTP backend until then.

### Active

#### P0 (current): mlx-native-runtime — pure-Rust native MLX runtime

Run MLX-community checkpoints through a **full native MLX forward** (no candle,
no Python, no subprocess) built on the upstream `oxideai/mlx-lm` Rust crate
(scaffolding + Qwen3 dense + Llama already done). Gives MLX's real wins (fusion,
no cross-runtime sync, day-one architectures) in one binary, and **retires
`mlx_lm.server`**. Supersedes both `mistralrs-mlx-direct` (bridge = structural
perf dead end) and the from-scratch `mlx-native-port`.

Spec: `docs/specs/mlx-native-runtime.md`. Branch: `feature/mlx-native`.
Decisions locked: vendor-fork `.vendor/mlx-lm` · broad catalog · top-of-chain
(retire mlx_lm.server) · build on the crate, port only missing models · forward
is 100% MLX, candle only as external oracle.

- [x] mlx-native-p0 - Phase 0 dense: **DONE** (Qwen3-4B-4bit correct + fast).
  - **AFQ load fixed** (3 upstream gaps: config quantization, single-file,
    `.inner.weight` key remap) -> 904/904 params load.
  - **Forward bug #1 FIXED** (`1bbe6e52`): dead KV cache (slots init'd None ->
    decode ran cache-less, repetition). Fix: `Some(C::default())`.
  - **Forward bug #2 FIXED**: mlx-rs `nn::Rope::forward` reshaped to 3D
    `[-1, L, head_dim]`; for decode (L=1) the `[B*n_heads, 1, head_dim]` shape
    trips an MLX fast-rope bug rotating only head 0, leaving later heads
    un-rotated -> garbage. Fix: RoPE on the 4D shape directly (like Python).
    **NOT the cause** (each cost real time): MLX version (0.31.2 reproduces it),
    mask, sinks, layout, device, SDPA. The 0.31.2 bump was done (mlx-c fft/ops
    patched to build) but didn't fix it -> reverted to 0.30.6 (rope fix is
    version-independent, keeps the submodule unpatched).
  - **Result:** Qwen3-4B-4bit byte-identical to mlx_lm ("The capital of France
    is Paris"), **~106 T/s** (> candle ~100, ~10x bridge). Native-MLX thesis
    fully proven (fast AND correct).
- [x] mlx-native-p0b - `MlxNativeBackend` wired into the gateway (`b25497c`).
  - MLX is `!Send` (one Metal stream) -> a dedicated worker thread owns the
    model for life, loads it itself, serves jobs off a channel, streams
    `ChatEvent`s back; the backend is a thin Send+Sync handle. Chat-template
    render (system/user/assistant/tool), EOS/max-tokens/cancel stop, UTF-8-safe
    incremental detokenize (holds a trailing replacement char so mid-Cyrillic
    never leaks). `concurrency_capacity()=1` -> `admit_wrap` gates it.
  - `mlx-native` feature (off by default) + path deps on the vendored fork
    (swap to a git-rev pin at merge, like mistralrs). `build_gateway_backend`
    tries it before mistralrs for MLX checkpoints.
  - E2E test through the real SPI: streams a correct "Paris" answer in ~3.7s
    incl. load. `cargo check --features mlx-native` + fmt + lib suite clean.
  - Merged `origin/master` (the generic `concurrency` admission decorator +
    shared-gateway) into the branch; clean.
  - Gaps still open: hf-hub auto-download; sampler top_p/top_k/rep-penalty
    (Generate only takes temp today); tool-use streaming; EOS list from config.
- [x] mlx-native-p1 - Phase 1: port `qwen3_moe`; gated on `Qwen3-30B-A3B-4bit`.
  - Dense Qwen3 attention reused verbatim; sparse MoE MLP = router gate
    (quantized Linear) -> softmax -> argpartition top-8 -> `take_along_axis`
    scores -> `SwitchGLU` experts via `gather_qmm` -> weighted sum. Experts are
    AFQ 3D `[E,out,in]` raw `Param<Array>`; target-aware load remap adds
    `.inner.weight` only where that param exists (QuantizedLinear leaves) so the
    experts keep `.weight`. Token-sort skipped (gather_qmm identical sorted/not).
  - **Greedy byte-for-byte identical to Python `mlx_lm`** on Qwen3-30B-A3B-4bit:
    `<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.` Loads 1351 params,
    full load+gen in ~4.6s. Backend dispatches qwen3/qwen3_moe by `model_type`
    via a `LoadedModel` enum + shared generic streaming loop. (Downloaded the
    gate model, ~17GB.) E2E test `mlx_moe_chat_capital`.
  - All 48 layers sparse (mlp_only=[]); dense MoE layers fail loud for now.
- [x] mlx-native-p2 - Phase 2: port `qwen3_5` (27B dense) + `qwen3_5_moe`
  (35B-A3B) hybrid; gate on cached `Qwen3.6-{27B,35B-A3B}-4bit`. Headline: the
  models the user runs, pure-Rust. Qwen3-Next family,
  the hard phase — COMPLETE. Scope mapped from Python `qwen3_5`/`qwen3_next`/`gated_delta`:
  - **DONE (fork `364cebf6`):** the GatedDeltaNet delta-rule recurrence
    (`models/gated_delta.rs`, ops path — mlx-rs has no custom-kernel support, so
    O(T) prefill but byte-exact). Unit-test validated vs Python `gated_delta_ops`
    (<1e-3 on a seed-0 case). compute_g + delta_step + sequential scan.
  - **Phase 2a DONE — `qwen3_5` (Qwen3.6-27B) byte-exact** (fork `9df1dd15`,
    rozum `b39a49c`). `models/qwen3_5.rs`: output-gated full attention (every 4th
    layer; q_proj->queries+gate, `o_proj(out*sigmoid(gate))`, partial RoPE
    rotary_dim=head_dim*0.25 — mRoPE keys ignored for text, confirmed correct) +
    GatedDeltaNet linear layers (depthwise `Conv1d` + causal conv-state cache +
    the f32 delta scan) + heterogeneous `LayerCache::{Full(KV), Linear{conv,state}}`
    + RMSNormGated + weightless q/k rms_norm. Backend `Qwen35` arm; jinja template
    fallback; sharded-no-index load; `language_model.` prefix strip (skip vision
    tower); config under `text_config` (rope from nested `rope_parameters`).
    **Bugs found+fixed during bring-up** (localized via per-layer L2 dumps vs a
    Python oracle): the mlx-community 4bit checkpoint is already sanitized so the
    RMSNorm +1 must NOT be re-applied (was doubling norms -> 6x blowup); the delta
    recurrence must run in f32 not bf16 (greedy drift); and the `A_log` param key
    is capitalized (was loading as ones -> wrong decay). Greedy output identical
    to Python mlx_lm: "Here's a thinking process:" (per-layer L2 to ~0.1%). E2E
    test `mlx_qwen35_chat`.
  - **Phase 2b DONE — `qwen3_5_moe` (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)** (fork `f27ddc42`, rozum
    `223fd69`). Reuses the qwen3_5 backbone verbatim (attention + GatedDeltaNet +
    LayerCache, made pub) + the qwen3_moe SwitchGLU (made pub); every layer's MLP
    is a sparse MoE block = router gate + top-k SwitchGLU + a shared expert gated
    by `sigmoid(shared_expert_gate(x))`. **Per-module quant**: the router gate and
    shared_expert_gate are 8-bit (rest 4-bit) and nn::quantize is uniform-only, so
    those two are raw `QuantLinear` (quantized_matmul) outside nn::quantize; the
    4-bit experts stay raw SwitchGLU; the rest go through nn::quantize at 4-bit.
    `intermediate_size` optional (pure-MoE omits it). Greedy output matches Python
    mlx_lm: "Thinking Process:" — worked on the first forward run (only two config
    fixes needed). E2E test `mlx_qwen35_moe_chat`. **Phase 2 COMPLETE.**
- [ ] mlx-native-p3 - Phase 3: broaden catalog (Llama upstream; Qwen2.5 /
  Qwen2.5-Coder deltas). SKIPPED for now (user request) — revisit after p4.
- [x] mlx-native-p4 - Phase 4: native MLX is the DEFAULT backend; `mlx_lm.server`
  retired (rozum `74b458a`). `default = ["mlx-native"]` (was `["mistralrs"]`);
  mistralrs is now opt-in `--features mistralrs` (broader-catalog candle fallback,
  still tried after native MLX). Removed `try_mlx_server` + its chain step; the
  in-process native runtime supersedes the Python server. Chain is now GGUF ->
  native MLX -> mistralrs (opt-in) -> LM Studio HTTP -> ROZUM_BACKEND_URL. SPEC.md
  resolution chain + no-backend hints + select-failed note updated. Default and
  `--features mistralrs` both build clean. **Open: reproducibility** — mlx-native
  still uses path deps into the gitignored `.vendor/`; merge-to-master must push
  the fork (`sergey-scherbina/mlx-rs` branch `rozum-mlx-native`) and switch to a
  git-rev pin (like the mistralrs `[patch.crates-io]`) so the default builds
  off-tree.

#### SUPERSEDED: mistralrs-mlx-direct — targeted candle->MLX quant-op bridge

Proven dead end (kept as a parity oracle in `feature/mistralrs-mlx-direct`).
Correct (byte-identical on Qwen3-4B) but **slower than candle** (11.76 vs 100.74
T/s) due to a structural per-op cross-runtime GPU-sync floor. MLX speed is
all-or-nothing -> the native runtime above is the right path. p0/p1/p1b records
kept below; p2/p3/p4 cancelled.

Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-mlx-direct.md`. Decisions: targeted quant-ops ·
`mlx-rs` · in the `.vendor/mistral-rs` fork, generic.

- [x] mlx-direct-p0 - Phase 0: bridge prototype + single-op parity. **DONE**
  (fork branch `mlx-direct`, commit `14e699a26`).
  - `mlx-direct` feature + `mlx-rs = "0.25.3"` added; copy-baseline bridge
    (`afq/mlx_bridge.rs`) + `afq/mlx_direct.rs` (dequantize + quantized_matmul);
    runtime switch in `afq_dequantize_op`/`afq_mm_op`.
  - Gate PASSED (`--test-threads=1`): MLX dequantize vs candle (diff < 1e-4);
    MLX quantized_matmul vs candle dequant+matmul (diff < 1e-3).
  - Finding: no candle+MLX coexistence deadlock; the deadlock chase was a
    standalone `afq_mm_op` splitk `sum(0)` hang, reproduced with NO MLX linked.
    Metal tests must run single-threaded; `kill -9` of a hung Metal test wedges
    the GPU. Details in spec Results.

- [x] mlx-direct-p1 - Phase 1: dense model correctness. **DONE** (fork commit
  `a7ea747ea`; feature plumbed quant -> core -> cli).
  - `mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit` via `mistralrs run`, `MISTRALRS_MLX_DIRECT`
    0 vs 1, same seed: **generation byte-identical** (623 chars, 136 tokens,
    `A: Paris.`). No deadlock under full-forward candle<->MLX interleaving.
  - **Perf regression: 2.89 vs 100.74 T/s (~35x).** Copy baseline's CPU
    round-trip + per-op sync. Correct but not shippable.
  - Cross-check vs `mlx_lm` not run (not installed); ON==OFF vs the mlx_lm-
    validated candle path stands in.

- [~] mlx-direct-p1b - Phase 1b: bridge perf. **PARTIAL.** (fork `c5986e13d`)
  - Weight-array cache (memoize candle->MLX of constant AFQ weights by Metal
    buffer addr): Qwen3-4B-4bit decode **2.89 -> 11.76 T/s (~4x)**, output still
    byte-identical. Banked.
  - **Remaining ~8.6x gap is structural:** per-op cross-runtime GPU sync (candle
    drain to host for `x` + MLX eval for the result = 2 syncs x ~250 quant
    ops/token). candle alone runs the same ops at 100 T/s via one queue + batched
    commits. Cutting this needs shared-MTLBuffer + shared-queue/event ordering,
    which is NOT reachable via public APIs (candle Private storage; mlx-c adopt
    wants void* not MTLBuffer; no cross-queue event exposed), OR widening the
    MLX region toward a fuller native runtime. Open strategic decision.

- [x] mlx-direct-p2/p3/p4 - CANCELLED (superseded by mlx-native-runtime). The
  bridge cannot beat candle (structural per-op sync floor), so wiring MoE
  gather, generalizing bit-widths, and the zero-copy spike no longer pay off.
  The native MLX runtime gets MLX speed by owning the whole forward instead.

#### mistralrs-concurrency-scheduling — responsive, memory-budgeted concurrency

Replace the blunt `max_num_seqs` 1/2 ladder with a layered model: budgeted
engine capacity (A), a rozum-side admission scheduler decoupled from the static
engine knob (B), priority + a reserved fast lane so small interactive requests
never queue behind big ones (C), and bounded-queue backpressure + an OOM circuit
breaker (D). Memory sets the upper bound; the Metal single-GPU compute sweet spot
sets the ceiling. Deliver synergistically in the order A → B+C → D (A lifts the
floor to 2 so a fast lane is physically possible).

Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-concurrency-scheduling.md`. Builds on the constant
per-prefill cost from `mistralrs-chunked-prefill.md` (~465 KB/token × chunk).

- [x] concurrency-budget - Phase A: load-time budgeted engine `max_num_seqs`. **DONE.**
  - `budgeted_max_num_seqs(ConcurrencyBudget)` = `clamp(headroom/per_seq, 1, ceiling)`,
    `headroom = safety_frac*available - weights - kv_pool`, `per_seq = prefill_chunk * ~465KB`.
  - Reuse `main.rs` footprint helpers (weights, kv_cache_bytes, available_ram_bytes).
  - Floor 1; lift to ≥2 only when headroom covers one extra `per_seq` (fast-lane room).
  - `ROZUM_MISTRALRS_MAX_SEQS` forces exact; `ROZUM_MISTRALRS_SEQS_CEILING` caps (default 8).
  - Replaces the 24-36 GB→1 / ≥48 GB→2 ladder. Pure fn unit-tested without Xcode.

- [x] concurrency-admission - Phase B+C: admission scheduler + fast lane. **DONE.**
  - `AdmissionScheduler` semaphore ≤ engine capacity, limit via `ROZUM_MISTRALRS_ADMIT`.
  - `chat()` acquires `AdmitGuard` before the engine; releases on done/cancel/drop.
  - SJF ordering by `RequestCost (prompt+max_tokens)`; reserved fast-lane slot for
    cost < `ROZUM_MISTRALRS_FASTLANE_TOKENS` (default 1024, 0 disables).
  - Finding: fork does NOT yield between prefill chunks (chunk loop is inside
    `pipeline::step`) → admission-order responsiveness only; mid-prefill preempt
    deferred to backlog `concurrency-engine-yield`.
  - Disconnect cancel/reap preserved for queued + admitted requests.

- [x] concurrency-load-shedding - Phase D: backpressure + circuit breaker. **DONE.**
  - Bounded queue `ROZUM_MISTRALRS_QUEUE_MAX` (default 32) → `Overloaded` → gateway 429 + Retry-After.
  - Metal alloc failure → `trip()` drops limit (floor 1), cooldown `recover_step()` raises back. No auto-retry (avoids re-OOM); best-effort substring detection.
  - Per-class `max_tokens` dropped (redundant with cost weighting). Invariants covered by scheduler tests.

**`mistralrs-concurrency-scheduling` complete (A + B+C + D).** Follow-ups in BACKLOG;
the big one is `concurrency-engine-yield` (true mid-prefill interleaving).

- [x] concurrency-backend-abstraction - Lift the admission machinery out of mistralrs into a generic `src/concurrency` module + `AdmittingBackend` decorator. **DONE.**
  - `ChatBackend::concurrency_capacity() -> Option<usize>` (default None); `admit_wrap` gates iff `Some`, passthrough otherwise (safe default for remote backends).
  - mistralrs reports `Some(max_num_seqs)`; its `chat()` is plain inference again. Generic `ROZUM_ADMIT*` env. The new mlx-rs backend gets admission/fast-lane/backpressure/breaker for free by returning a capacity.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/concurrency-backend-abstraction.md`.

#### shared-gateway — one shared model process, many launch clients

Make the model-serving gateway a shared, single-instance detached process that
`rozum launch` clients discover & reuse, so two launches don't load two models
and OOM. Single-owner election (TCP-port bind + advisory flock), transparent
failover on a stable port, idle shutdown via client leases. `--model` becomes
optional (reuse running / interactive picker). Adds `rozum models rm`.
Composes with `concurrency` (sharing = one model; AdmittingBackend = N clients).

Spec: `docs/specs/shared-gateway.md`.

- [x] shared-gateway-mvp - Detached `rozum gateway` daemon (registers `active.json`,
  stable port, idle-timeout exit). `rozum launch` discovers a healthy compatible
  gateway and reuses it, else spawns one (port-bind dedup; flock deferred to
  failover) and waits for health, then execs the agent. `--dedicated` keeps the
  old in-process behaviour. **DONE.**
- [x] shared-gateway-failover - Launch-side watchdog respawns the daemon on death
  (same port), anti-stampede via `share::try_spawn_lock` (O_EXCL stale-steal),
  port-bind backstop. Agent reconnects over the brief gap via its own retry. **DONE.**
- [x] shared-gateway-leases - Lease-refcount lifetime (`leases/<pid>` heartbeat,
  mtime-reap) keeps the daemon up while clients are live; `rozum gateway status`/`stop`. **DONE.**
- [x] launch-model-picker - `--model` optional: omitted+running → reuse (print
  model); omitted+none on a TTY → interactive picker (cached first with
  `(cached, size)` / `(not cached, ~size)` annotations; non-cached → download
  confirm); non-TTY → error. Mismatch policy: takeover-if-idle else reuse-with-warning. **DONE.**
- [x] models-rm - `rozum models rm <spec>`: confirm, refuse if it is the active
  model, delete HF/LMStudio dirs directly (Ollama via `ollama rm`), report freed size. **DONE.**
- [x] shared-gateway-proxy - Launch-local model-free reverse proxy in the request
  path (agent → proxy → daemon), mirroring `mcp-proxy`. Foundation for replay /
  poison / transparent swap. Re-points the agent at the proxy's local port. **DONE.**
- [ ] shared-gateway-replay-retry - Buffer + replay a request when the daemon dies
  **before the first streamed token**; mid-stream failures surface. Smart retry:
  backoff + jitter, attempt cap, wait-for-health. **Two-tier admission**: daemon
  advertises room (headers + `GET /v1/admit`); each proxy holds its client's
  requests in its own `concurrency::AdmissionScheduler` (SJF + fast lane) and only
  forwards within the daemon's window — prompts wait at the edge, not bounced.
- [ ] shared-gateway-poison - Soft/graduated: per-fingerprint crash count;
  degrade-then-retry (serialize) first; refuse 422 only after `ROZUM_POISON_MAX`
  (default 3); share to TTL'd `poison.json` (default 1 h, decay-on-success) only
  on sole-in-flight high confidence — ambiguous stays local to the proxy.
- [ ] gateway-switch - `rozum gateway switch --model Y [--backend B]` / `reload` /
  `unload`: in-place drain (admission limit → 0) → unload → load → resume; proxies
  hold requests across the gap. Transparent model/backend swap + binary upgrade.

- [ ] runtime-config - Load backend policy and backend list from `rozum.toml`.
  - Support `single`, `fallback`, and `fanout` policies.
  - Support every `BackendEngine` defined in code (`Hello`, `Candle`, `LlamaGguf`, `NativeRust`, `ExternalCommand`, `Gguf`, plus the `mistralrs`/`openai-http` shapes once we settle on their config schema).
  - Provide a sensible default config that mirrors the gateway/launch auto-detect chain (in-process GGUF → mistralrs → mlx_lm.server → ROZUM_BACKEND_URL).
  - Useful when a user routinely switches between multiple local + remote backends in different sessions without re-typing `--model`.
  - Spec first: `docs/specs/runtime-config.md`.

### Qwen3.6 unblocking track (three escalating upstream fixes)

Ordered cheapest → most strategic. Pick up the first one that lands; downstream
ones still pay off long-term but the user-facing Qwen3.6 problem is solved as
soon as any single track succeeds.

- [ ] llamacpp-qwen36-patch - Upstream PR to llama.cpp accepting `qwen35moe.rope.dimension_sections` length 3.
  - Single hyperparam loader fix (~50 LoC). Concrete error logged with Qwen3.6 GGUF from `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF`.
  - Patched llama.cpp → patched llama-cpp-2 version bump → `cargo update` in rozum and `--features gguf` works for Qwen3.6.
  - Estimated effort: ~1 week active + upstream review cycle.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/llamacpp-qwen36-patch.md`.

- [ ] mistralrs-qwen36-pr - Upstream PR to mistralrs registering Qwen3.5/3.6 as an alias of the existing `qwen3_next` model.
  - Discovery: mistralrs already has all the hybrid linear-attention layer code in `qwen3_next.rs` (GatedDeltaNet, full-attention, SparseMoeBlock, MoE routing). mlx-lm's `qwen3_5.py` re-uses `qwen3_next.py` classes verbatim — same architecture.
  - The PR is therefore not new layer code; it's: (a) register `model_type: "qwen3_5_moe"` and `architectures: ["Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration"]` to dispatch to the existing `Qwen3NextLoader`; (b) tolerate the nested `text_config` block + explicit `layer_types` array in the config parser; (c) handle `attn_output_gate` if it changes behaviour.
  - Correctness gate: byte-for-byte token match against `mlx_lm.generate --temp 0`.
  - Highest-leverage: every Rust project that uses mistralrs picks up Qwen3.5/3.6.
  - Estimated effort: ~1 week active (down from 2-3 weeks after the qwen3_next discovery).
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-qwen36-pr.md`.

- [ ] mlx-native-port - Native MLX runtime in rozum on top of `mlx-rs`, porting `mlx_lm` Python piece by piece.
  - Phased: Phase 0 (bootstrap) → Phase 1 (Qwen3-4B dense) → Phase 2 (Qwen3 MoE) → Phase 3 (Qwen3.6 hybrid). Each phase has a numerical-match exit criterion.
  - Removes our dependency on mistralrs / llama-cpp-2 release cycles entirely; new model families become ~3-5 day port tasks instead of "wait for upstream".
  - New crate feature `mlx-native` (off by default — heavy compile, big code surface).
  - Estimated effort: ~5-8 calendar weeks for parity with current mistralrs scope.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mlx-native-port.md`.

### Done

- [x] lmstudio-http-backend - Auto-detect LM Studio's local OpenAI-compatible server at `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
  - Unlocks Qwen3.6 (and any LM Studio MLX model) on Apple Silicon today, ahead of in-process mistralrs AFQ work.
  - Inserts above `mlx_lm.server` in the `build_gateway_backend` priority chain.
  - Reuses the existing `OpenAiHttpBackend` SSE parser; no new dependencies.
  - Env: `ROZUM_LMSTUDIO_HTTP=http://host:port/v1` to override the default endpoint.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/lmstudio-http-backend.md`.

- [x] idle-cpu-reduction - Event-driven TUI / room loops; ~0% CPU when idle.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/idle-cpu-reduction.md`.

- [x] chat-backend-spi - Async streaming `ChatBackend` trait with tool-use, sampling params, cancel; replaces the old sync `InferenceBackend`.
  - Content blocks (`Text` / `ToolUse` / `ToolResult`) in the SPI from day 1.
  - Helper `collect_to_string` for meeting call-sites that still need a final `String`.
  - `BackendOrchestrator` (Single / Fallback / FanOut) rewritten on async streams.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/chat-backend-spi.md`.

- [x] gguf-backend - In-process GGUF inference on Metal via llama-cpp-2.
  - Crate feature `gguf`. Path resolvers for absolute paths, `lmstudio:<repo>`, and Ollama-cached tags (`<name>[:<tag>]`, reading `~/.ollama/models/blobs/` without a running daemon).
  - Streaming, per-token cancel, prompt-cache by `session_id`, Qwen-hermes tool-use parser.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/gguf-backend.md`.

- [x] mistralrs-backend - In-process native-MLX backend via the `mistralrs` crate (on by default).
  - Loads MLX safetensors directly: `mlx-community:<repo>`, `hf:<user>/<repo>`, or local directory. Auto-download via `hf-hub`.
  - Streaming token-by-token; per-token cancel; reuses `crate::gguf::ToolUseParser` for tool calls.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-backend.md`.

- [x] api-gateway - Outward HTTP gateway exposing both OpenAI and Anthropic dialects on `127.0.0.1`.
  - `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI SSE with `tool_calls`), `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic event-stream with `tool_use` blocks).
  - Context-overflow → HTTP 400 with a clear error. Cancel propagates from client disconnect.
  - Optional bearer auth via `ROZUM_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. Bind always `127.0.0.1`.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/api-gateway.md`.

- [x] launch-wrapper - `rozum launch --model X <program>` starts the gateway and execs the agent CLI with `ANTHROPIC_*` / `OPENAI_*` env vars pre-set.
  - Uses `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (rank-2 in Claude Code auth precedence) so the local model wins without `claude /logout`.
  - Sets `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` + the four `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL` slots so Claude Code starts on the local model without a manual `/model` pick.
  - Enables `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` so the model shows up in the `/model` picker with `display_name`.
  - Argument reordering pre-parser accepts both `--model X claude` and `claude --model X`; `--` separator forwards remaining args verbatim.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/launch-wrapper.md`.

- [x] models-cli - `rozum models {list, list --remote, info <spec>}` for discovering and inspecting local LLM models.
  - Scans HuggingFace hub, Ollama (both monolithic GGUF and per-tensor MLX layouts), and LMStudio caches without needing those runtimes running.
  - `list --remote` prints a curated download list optimised for 24-36 GB Apple Silicon unified memory.
  - `info <spec>` fetches HuggingFace metadata for not-installed models (author, downloads, license, total size, tags) and prints the install command.

### Cancelled / Superseded

These were in the queue earlier but either landed as part of larger work or no longer match the current product direction.

- [x] meeting-cli-surface — done as part of the current CLI shape: bare `rozum` launches a meeting, `rozum list` / `rozum mcp-proxy` are present, and the only user-facing model commands are `rozum gateway / launch / models`. No standalone "model diagnostics" CLI was ever shipped. Spec: `docs/specs/optional-local-models.md`.

- [x] agent-meetings — implemented as the default `rozum` runtime + `rozum mcp-proxy`. Claude Code / Codex sessions join via the MCP proxy and a human participates through the TUI. Moderator modes, budget, and hotkeys live in `src/meeting/`. Spec: `docs/specs/agent-meetings*.md`.

- [x] remote-api-backends — superseded by two newer pieces of work: `OpenAiHttpBackend` already speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions dialect against any compatible server (Ollama, mlx_lm.server, vLLM, OpenAI itself) via `ROZUM_BACKEND_URL`, and `api-gateway` exposes both OpenAI and Anthropic dialects locally. A symmetric `AnthropicHttpClient` backend (so rozum can call out to api.anthropic.com) is captured separately under `anthropic-http-client-backend` in `BACKLOG.md`.

- [x] smollm2-chat-template — superseded by per-backend chat templating: `gguf::format_qwen_prompt` for GGUF backends (Qwen / ChatML format with tool defs); mistralrs's own template applier for MLX backends; the gateway forwards chat templates upstream for OpenAI-HTTP backends. No standalone SmolLM2-specific layer is needed.

- [x] eval-harness — no longer in scope while the product focus is "local LLM provider for Claude Code / Codex". Evals matter when we are choosing between local models for accuracy; right now we are choosing for "does it run at all on M-series with the target architecture", which is best answered by trying the model in `rozum launch`. Will reopen as `local-llm-eval-harness` in `BACKLOG.md` if/when we need it.

## Done Criteria

- `cargo fmt --check` passes.
- `cargo test` passes.
- `cargo build --release` passes.
- `cargo build --no-default-features` produces a meeting-room-only binary.
- Bare `rozum` starts a meeting room without model inference.
- User-facing CLI commands are `gateway`, `launch`, `models`, `list`, `mcp-proxy`, `web`, `discord`, `telegram`.
- Specs for completed items have checked behavior boxes and results.
