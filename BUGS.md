## BUG-001 — agentic matrix reboots the Mac (kernel panic on gateway teardown)

- **Status:** fixed (harness-side; ported to master 2026-06-18)
- **Reporter:** found in-house (heavy-bench days); root-caused in
  `[[project-matrix-kernel-panic]]`.
- **Severity:** P0 — reboots the host, so any matrix run is untrustworthy.

**Symptom.** Running `scripts/bench/agentic.sh` over multiple models would reboot the Mac
(Mac16,6 / M4, macOS 26.5.1). Confirmed a **kernel panic**, not a RAM OOM / jetsam, from
`/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/*.panic`:
- `IOGPUGroupMemory::remove_memory_object() memory object not found @IOGPUGroupMemory.cpp:323`
  — the GPU driver double-frees / use-after-frees a Metal buffer the kernel already dropped.
- A later instance: `watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 93s` with P-cores
  offline — the GPU/system fully wedged, then watchdog-killed.

**Repro (DESTRUCTIVE — do not run to reproduce).** The full matrix reboots the machine.
This was localized by **code-path analysis**, not by re-running, precisely because the repro
is a host reboot.

**Root cause.** The harness tore each model's shared gateway down with
`kill -INT` → wait 60 s → **unconditional `kill -KILL`** (`agentic.sh`). rozum has graceful
shutdown and `join()`s the MLX worker on Drop, but if the final Metal eval is **wedged under
memory pressure** the worker thread is stuck inside a GPU dispatch, Drop's `join()` blocks,
the 60 s grace expires, and `kill -KILL` lands **on top of live GPU command buffers** →
IOGPU accounting corruption → kernel panic. `ROZUM_MLX_RETAIN` (retained command buffers for
the hybrid-decode fast path) widens the window.

**Fix (harness-side, validated no-panic on 27B on the original
`feature/matrix-teardown-panic-fix` branch; that branch went 70 commits stale, so the
still-needed change was ported fresh onto current master rather than merged):**
`scripts/bench/agentic.sh` now tears the gateway down **gracefully**: `kill -INT` →
wait `TEARDOWN_GRACE` (180 s, env-overridable) for a clean exit → SIGKILL **only as a loudly
flagged last resort** → then a `GPU_SETTLE` (8 s) pause to let the kernel finish async IOGPU
reclamation before the next gateway allocates on the same Metal device. Also adds
`ROZUM_GATEWAY_UNLOAD_IDLE_SECS=0` to the gateway launch so the shared gateway isn't
self-exited (`clients_gone`) between the claude/codex phases — see
`[[project-agentic-bench-clients-gone]]` (a different matrix bug, co-fixed here as it makes
the run reach a clean teardown at all).

- **Fix commit:** `326bb9d` (`scripts/bench/agentic.sh` graceful teardown + idle-secs).

**Open follow-up (defense-in-depth, NOT done — deliberately).** The deepest fix is rozum
*itself* guaranteeing a bounded, non-wedging teardown (a real Metal-eval timeout that returns
control; ensure Drop's `join()` can't block forever). That touches the GPU teardown hot path
(`mlx_native_backend.rs` Drop/join, `gateway.rs` `shutdown_signal`) and **cannot be validated
without risking a reboot**, so it is left as a tracked follow-up rather than shipped blind.
The harness fix removes the proven panic trigger (SIGKILL into a live eval); this hardens the
engine so even a buggy/aggressive harness can't panic the GPU.
