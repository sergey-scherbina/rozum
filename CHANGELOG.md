## web-autosize-input — Claude-style autosizing textarea in the web client
Completed: 2026-06-06
Replaced the single-line `<input id="msg">` with a `<textarea rows="1">` that
grows upward on input up to `30vh` (`20vh` on mobile). `Enter` sends,
`Shift+Enter` inserts a newline, `Esc` clears, no horizontal scroll, collapses
back to one row after send. Verified live by the operator.
