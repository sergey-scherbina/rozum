# Work Queue

Current sprint focus: (1) make Rozum a reliable local meeting room for live agents and a human operator; (2) make Rozum a local LLM provider for Claude Code and Codex via an outward OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible gateway backed by an in-process MLX / GGUF engine on Apple Silicon Metal.

## Sprint

### Active

- [ ] runtime-config - Load backend policy and backend list from `rozum.toml`.
  - Support `single`, `fallback`, and `fanout` policies.
  - Support every `BackendEngine` defined in code (`Hello`, `Candle`, `LlamaGguf`, `NativeRust`, `ExternalCommand`, `Gguf`, plus the `mistralrs`/`openai-http` shapes once we settle on their config schema).
  - Provide a sensible default config that mirrors the gateway/launch auto-detect chain (in-process GGUF → mistralrs → mlx_lm.server → ROZUM_BACKEND_URL).
  - Useful when a user routinely switches between multiple local + remote backends in different sessions without re-typing `--model`.
  - Spec first: `docs/specs/runtime-config.md`.

### Qwen3.6 unblocking track (three escalating upstream fixes)

Ordered cheapest → most strategic. Pick up the first one that lands; downstream
ones still pay off long-term but the user-facing Qwen3.6 problem is solved as
soon as any single track succeeds.

- [ ] llamacpp-qwen36-patch - Upstream PR to llama.cpp accepting `qwen35moe.rope.dimension_sections` length 3.
  - Single hyperparam loader fix (~50 LoC). Concrete error logged with Qwen3.6 GGUF from `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF`.
  - Patched llama.cpp → patched llama-cpp-2 version bump → `cargo update` in rozum and `--features gguf` works for Qwen3.6.
  - Estimated effort: ~1 week active + upstream review cycle.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/llamacpp-qwen36-patch.md`.

- [ ] mistralrs-qwen36-pr - Upstream PR to mistralrs registering Qwen3.5/3.6 as an alias of the existing `qwen3_next` model.
  - Discovery: mistralrs already has all the hybrid linear-attention layer code in `qwen3_next.rs` (GatedDeltaNet, full-attention, SparseMoeBlock, MoE routing). mlx-lm's `qwen3_5.py` re-uses `qwen3_next.py` classes verbatim — same architecture.
  - The PR is therefore not new layer code; it's: (a) register `model_type: "qwen3_5_moe"` and `architectures: ["Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration"]` to dispatch to the existing `Qwen3NextLoader`; (b) tolerate the nested `text_config` block + explicit `layer_types` array in the config parser; (c) handle `attn_output_gate` if it changes behaviour.
  - Correctness gate: byte-for-byte token match against `mlx_lm.generate --temp 0`.
  - Highest-leverage: every Rust project that uses mistralrs picks up Qwen3.5/3.6.
  - Estimated effort: ~1 week active (down from 2-3 weeks after the qwen3_next discovery).
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-qwen36-pr.md`.

- [ ] mlx-native-port - Native MLX runtime in rozum on top of `mlx-rs`, porting `mlx_lm` Python piece by piece.
  - Phased: Phase 0 (bootstrap) → Phase 1 (Qwen3-4B dense) → Phase 2 (Qwen3 MoE) → Phase 3 (Qwen3.6 hybrid). Each phase has a numerical-match exit criterion.
  - Removes our dependency on mistralrs / llama-cpp-2 release cycles entirely; new model families become ~3-5 day port tasks instead of "wait for upstream".
  - New crate feature `mlx-native` (off by default — heavy compile, big code surface).
  - Estimated effort: ~5-8 calendar weeks for parity with current mistralrs scope.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mlx-native-port.md`.

### Done

- [x] idle-cpu-reduction - Event-driven TUI / room loops; ~0% CPU when idle.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/idle-cpu-reduction.md`.

- [x] chat-backend-spi - Async streaming `ChatBackend` trait with tool-use, sampling params, cancel; replaces the old sync `InferenceBackend`.
  - Content blocks (`Text` / `ToolUse` / `ToolResult`) in the SPI from day 1.
  - Helper `collect_to_string` for meeting call-sites that still need a final `String`.
  - `BackendOrchestrator` (Single / Fallback / FanOut) rewritten on async streams.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/chat-backend-spi.md`.

- [x] gguf-backend - In-process GGUF inference on Metal via llama-cpp-2.
  - Crate feature `gguf`. Path resolvers for absolute paths, `lmstudio:<repo>`, and Ollama-cached tags (`<name>[:<tag>]`, reading `~/.ollama/models/blobs/` without a running daemon).
  - Streaming, per-token cancel, prompt-cache by `session_id`, Qwen-hermes tool-use parser.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/gguf-backend.md`.

- [x] mistralrs-backend - In-process native-MLX backend via the `mistralrs` crate (on by default).
  - Loads MLX safetensors directly: `mlx-community:<repo>`, `hf:<user>/<repo>`, or local directory. Auto-download via `hf-hub`.
  - Streaming token-by-token; per-token cancel; reuses `crate::gguf::ToolUseParser` for tool calls.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/mistralrs-backend.md`.

- [x] api-gateway - Outward HTTP gateway exposing both OpenAI and Anthropic dialects on `127.0.0.1`.
  - `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI SSE with `tool_calls`), `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic event-stream with `tool_use` blocks).
  - Context-overflow → HTTP 400 with a clear error. Cancel propagates from client disconnect.
  - Optional bearer auth via `ROZUM_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. Bind always `127.0.0.1`.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/api-gateway.md`.

- [x] launch-wrapper - `rozum launch --model X <program>` starts the gateway and execs the agent CLI with `ANTHROPIC_*` / `OPENAI_*` env vars pre-set.
  - Uses `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (rank-2 in Claude Code auth precedence) so the local model wins without `claude /logout`.
  - Sets `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` + the four `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL` slots so Claude Code starts on the local model without a manual `/model` pick.
  - Enables `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` so the model shows up in the `/model` picker with `display_name`.
  - Argument reordering pre-parser accepts both `--model X claude` and `claude --model X`; `--` separator forwards remaining args verbatim.
  - Spec: `docs/specs/launch-wrapper.md`.

- [x] models-cli - `rozum models {list, list --remote, info <spec>}` for discovering and inspecting local LLM models.
  - Scans HuggingFace hub, Ollama (both monolithic GGUF and per-tensor MLX layouts), and LMStudio caches without needing those runtimes running.
  - `list --remote` prints a curated download list optimised for 24-36 GB Apple Silicon unified memory.
  - `info <spec>` fetches HuggingFace metadata for not-installed models (author, downloads, license, total size, tags) and prints the install command.

### Cancelled / Superseded

These were in the queue earlier but either landed as part of larger work or no longer match the current product direction.

- [x] meeting-cli-surface — done as part of the current CLI shape: bare `rozum` launches a meeting, `rozum list` / `rozum mcp-proxy` are present, and the only user-facing model commands are `rozum gateway / launch / models`. No standalone "model diagnostics" CLI was ever shipped. Spec: `docs/specs/optional-local-models.md`.

- [x] agent-meetings — implemented as the default `rozum` runtime + `rozum mcp-proxy`. Claude Code / Codex sessions join via the MCP proxy and a human participates through the TUI. Moderator modes, budget, and hotkeys live in `src/meeting/`. Spec: `docs/specs/agent-meetings*.md`.

- [x] remote-api-backends — superseded by two newer pieces of work: `OpenAiHttpBackend` already speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions dialect against any compatible server (Ollama, mlx_lm.server, vLLM, OpenAI itself) via `ROZUM_BACKEND_URL`, and `api-gateway` exposes both OpenAI and Anthropic dialects locally. A symmetric `AnthropicHttpClient` backend (so rozum can call out to api.anthropic.com) is captured separately under `anthropic-http-client-backend` in `BACKLOG.md`.

- [x] smollm2-chat-template — superseded by per-backend chat templating: `gguf::format_qwen_prompt` for GGUF backends (Qwen / ChatML format with tool defs); mistralrs's own template applier for MLX backends; the gateway forwards chat templates upstream for OpenAI-HTTP backends. No standalone SmolLM2-specific layer is needed.

- [x] eval-harness — no longer in scope while the product focus is "local LLM provider for Claude Code / Codex". Evals matter when we are choosing between local models for accuracy; right now we are choosing for "does it run at all on M-series with the target architecture", which is best answered by trying the model in `rozum launch`. Will reopen as `local-llm-eval-harness` in `BACKLOG.md` if/when we need it.

## Done Criteria

- `cargo fmt --check` passes.
- `cargo test` passes (one pre-existing `proxy::tests::forwards_room_sampling_to_upstream_client` failure is unrelated to this sprint).
- `cargo build --release` passes.
- `cargo build --no-default-features` produces a meeting-room-only binary.
- Bare `rozum` starts a meeting room without model inference.
- User-facing CLI commands are `gateway`, `launch`, `models`, `list`, `mcp-proxy`, `web`, `discord`, `telegram`.
- Specs for completed items have checked behavior boxes and results.
